An in detail analysis of the Upsilon invariant mass data measured form the mesons produced in pp collisions at from √s = 8TeV from the first run of the LHCb experiment. he three Upsilon peaks, ϒ(1S),ϒ(2S), and ϒ(2S), were fitted using a model containing a Crystal
Ball and a Gaussian distribution plus a shallow falling exponential for the composite background. The masses of the peaks were found to be
µ1 =9.4560(2) GeV/c2
, µ2 = 10.0184(5) GeV/c2 , and µ3 = 10.3493(9) GeV/c2, with the total error quoted calculated from the statistical
error from the fit and from the systematic error due to the fitting model. These values are consistent with those found in the literature.
Lastly, the ratios for the differential cross-section times the branching fraction of the studied production, ϒ → µ+µ
−
, show that these ratios
are not dependant on the pseudorapidity but will increase when increasing the transverse momentum of the muon pair. This statement is in
concordance with the studies already done on this data set found in the literature.
